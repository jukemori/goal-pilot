CRITICAL TIMELINE CALCULATION (MUST FOLLOW):
- Time commitment: ${timeCommitment} minutes/day ร ${availableDaysCount} days = ${hoursPerWeek} hours/week
- Total hours needed for this goal: ${totalHoursNeeded} hours
- Total weeks required: ${totalHoursNeeded} รท ${hoursPerWeek} = ${totalWeeksNeeded} weeks
- Total years required: ${totalWeeksNeeded} รท 52 = ${totalYearsNeeded} years
- Completion date should be approximately: ${new Date(new Date(startDate).getTime() + totalWeeksNeeded * 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString().split('T')[0]}

YOUR PHASES MUST TOTAL EXACTLY ${totalWeeksNeeded} WEEKS!

Goal: ${goal}
Current Level Description: ${currentLevel}
Daily Time Commitment: ${timeCommitment} minutes
Available Days: ${availableDays}
Start Date: ${startDate}
${targetDate ? `Target Completion Date: ${targetDate}` : 'No specific deadline'}

IMPORTANT: 
- All dates must be in ${currentYear} or later. Use the start date (${startDate}) as your reference point.
- Carefully analyze the current level description to understand the user's starting point
- Design phases that build appropriately from their specific current knowledge/skills
- If they mention specific skills, technologies, or knowledge areas, incorporate these into early phases
- Avoid repeating content they already know based on their description

PHASE REQUIREMENTS:
- Create 6-12 SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE learning phases that cover the COMPLETE journey from the user's current level to mastery
- Phase durations must be realistic and shorter for better engagement:
  * For short timelines (< 12 weeks): 1-3 weeks per phase
  * For medium timelines (12-50 weeks): 2-8 weeks per phase
  * For long timelines (50+ weeks): 4-12 weeks per phase (MAX)
- CRITICAL: All phase durations MUST sum to exactly ${totalWeeksNeeded} weeks
- Each phase should have CONCRETE, MEASURABLE outcomes
- Focus on PRACTICAL APPLICATION rather than abstract theory
- Ensure phases build upon each other progressively with clear prerequisites
- Cover ALL essential skills, sub-skills, and competencies needed for mastery
- Include phases for: foundations, intermediate skills, advanced concepts, specialization, and mastery
- Each phase should have detailed descriptions explaining what will be accomplished
- Design phases to take someone from their current level to true professional competency

CRITICAL: MAKE PHASES EXTREMELY SPECIFIC AND DETAILED:
Instead of abstract titles like "Spanish Grammar Foundations", use specific topics:
- "Basic Spanish Greetings & Present Tense Conjugation (-ar verbs)"
- "Expressing Likes/Dislikes (me gusta) & Describing People/Places"
- "Past Tense (Preterite) & Time Expressions (ayer, la semana pasada)"

EXAMPLES OF SPECIFIC PHASE CONTENT BY DOMAIN:

REALISTIC TIMELINE CALCULATION:
- Calculate total hours needed realistically (don't underestimate)
- Time available per week: ${timeCommitment} minutes/day ร ${Object.values(weeklySchedule).filter(Boolean).length} days = ${Math.round(timeCommitment * Object.values(weeklySchedule).filter(Boolean).length / 60 * 10) / 10} hours/week
- For this specific goal: expect ${totalHoursNeeded} total hours
- Total weeks needed: Total hours รท hours per week (${totalHoursNeeded} hours รท ${Math.round(timeCommitment * Object.values(weeklySchedule).filter(Boolean).length / 60 * 10) / 10} hours/week = ${Math.round(totalHoursNeeded / (timeCommitment * Object.values(weeklySchedule).filter(Boolean).length / 60))} weeks)
- Phase durations must add up to the total realistic timeline
- IMPORTANT: Each phase duration must be calculated to fit within the realistic total timeline
- Include time for review, practice, and skill consolidation
- Account for the natural learning curve and plateau periods

CRITICAL: The sum of all phase durations must equal the total realistic weeks needed for mastery.

PHASE DETAIL REQUIREMENTS:
- Each phase must have comprehensive descriptions (3-5 sentences minimum)
- CRITICAL: Phase titles must be EXTREMELY SPECIFIC and detailed, not abstract

CALCULATION EXAMPLE FOR YOUR SPECIFIC CASE:
- You have ${timeCommitment} minutes/day ร ${Object.values(weeklySchedule).filter(Boolean).length} days/week = ${Math.round(timeCommitment * Object.values(weeklySchedule).filter(Boolean).length / 60 * 10) / 10} hours/week
- For this goal (${totalHoursNeeded} hours): ${totalHoursNeeded} รท ${Math.round(timeCommitment * Object.values(weeklySchedule).filter(Boolean).length / 60 * 10) / 10} = ${Math.round(totalHoursNeeded / (timeCommitment * Object.values(weeklySchedule).filter(Boolean).length / 60))} weeks = ${Math.round(totalHoursNeeded / (timeCommitment * Object.values(weeklySchedule).filter(Boolean).length / 60) / 52 * 10) / 10} years
- Your phases should total approximately ${Math.round(totalHoursNeeded / (timeCommitment * Object.values(weeklySchedule).filter(Boolean).length / 60))} weeks
- Example phase distribution: Adjust based on total timeline - shorter goals need shorter phases

IMPORTANT: 
- Do NOT include daily_tasks in the roadmap generation
- Tasks will be generated separately for each phase when requested
- Focus on creating comprehensive phase descriptions and realistic timelines
- Ensure the roadmap covers the COMPLETE journey to mastery
- VERIFY your math: Total phase weeks must equal realistic completion timeline

Consider the user's current level and available time. Make the roadmap realistic and achievable.
Break down complex goals into smaller, manageable phases with clear milestones.`

- Tasks should be CONCRETE, not abstract (e.g., "Complete Lesson 1-3 on Duolingo" not "Study vocabulary")
- Include specific websites, apps, books, or tools when relevant
- Mention specific quantities, timeframes, or metrics when possible

CRITICAL: TASKS MUST BE EXTREMELY SPECIFIC TO THE PHASE CONTENT:
