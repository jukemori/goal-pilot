## 📁 Key Files Changed (Last 2 Weeks)

### Most impactful changes:

1. **features/roadmap/hooks/** - All new hooks extracted
2. **components/organisms/roadmap-timeline/** - Simplified from 267 to 189 lines
3. **lib/utils/logger.ts** - New structured logging utility
4. **All API routes** - Logging cleanup
5. **All server actions** - Error handling + logging improvements

---

## 🔍 How to Navigate the Refactored Code

### For New Developers:

1. **Start here:** `features/` directory - organized by feature
2. **Data fetching:** Check `features/[feature]/hooks/`
3. **Server actions:** Check `features/[feature]/actions/`
4. **UI components:** Check `features/[feature]/components/`
5. **Shared utilities:** Check `lib/utils/`

### Common Patterns:

- **Data fetching:** Always use React Query hooks
- **Server actions:** Return ActionResult type
- **Logging:** Always use logger, never console
- **Error handling:** Structured errors with context
- **Component structure:** Presentation separate from data
